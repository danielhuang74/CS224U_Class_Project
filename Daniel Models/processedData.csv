21,"discounted cash flow analysis. kbw performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range of the present values of after-tax cash flows that cadence could provide to equity holders through 2015, assuming a $90.0 million common equity offering in the third quarter of 2010 at $1.00 per share. the analysis assumed a 6.00% underwriting discount and $300,000 of additional offering expenses. in performing this analysis, kbw used earnings and asset growth estimates for cadence for 2010 through 2015 from company management and assumed discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 16.0%. the range of values was determined by adding (1) ;the present value of projected cash dividends to cadence shareholders from 2010 to 2015, assuming excess capital is paid out to cadence shareholders and (2) ;the present value of the terminal value of cadence&#146;s common stock. in calculating the terminal value of cadence, kbw applied multiples ranging from 10.0x to 14.0x 2015 forecasted earnings. in determining cash flows available to shareholders, kbw assumed that cadence would maintain a tangible common equity / tangible assets ratio of 7.00% and any excess capital would be paid out to cadence shareholders. this resulted in a range of values of cadence from $0.93 to $1.32 per share.  kbw also considered and discussed with the cadence board how this analysis would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions of the capital raise, including variations with respect to the amount raised and offer price per share. to illustrate this impact, kbw performed a similar discounted cash flow analysis assuming capital raises ranging from $80.0 million to $100.0 million at offer prices from $0.50 per share to $1.50 per share. the analysis assumes a 12.0x terminal multiple on 2015 earnings and a 14.0% discount rate. this resulted in a range of values of cadence from $0.57 to $1.64.  kbw stated that the discounted cash flow present value analysis is a widely used valuation methodology but noted that it relies on numerous assumptions, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values and discount rates. the analysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of cadence.

24,"discounted cash flow analysis  in order to estimate the present value of the operations on the subject lands, tap securities performed three separate discounted cash flow analyses for each of three types of timberland comprising the subject lands: (i) ;plantation timberlands (not subject to timber deed), which are comprised of plantations operated in a manner that is standard and customary in the timberlands industry, (ii) ;plantation timberlands (subject to timber deed), which are comprised of plantations subject to a timber deed delivered in 2011, and (iii) ;non-plantation timberlands, which are comprised of all other timberlands on the subject lands, including naturally growing softwoods and hardwoods.  a discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the &#147;present value&#148; of estimated future cash flows of the asset as well as an asset&#146;s &#147;terminal value&#148;. &#147;present value&#148; refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors. &#147;terminal value&#148; refers to the residual value of the asset at the end of the forecast period.   to calculate the estimated value of the operations on the subject lands using the discounted cash flow method for each of the three types of timberland comprising the subject lands, tap securities calculated, based on information and estimates provided by st. joe&#146;s management and discounted using the mid-year convention (i) ;the estimated pre-tax present value of projected free cash flows for fiscal years (a) ;2014 through 2033, based on st. joe management&#146;s 20-year harvest plan for the subject lands, in respect of the plantation timberlands (not subject to timber deed); (b) ;2014 through 2038, in respect of the plantation timberlands (subject to timber deed) and (c) ;2014 through 2033, assuming an even flow of cash over such years, in respect of the non-plantation timberlands and (ii) ;terminal value by applying real price appreciation percentage ranges of (1.0%) ;to 1.0% to the timberlands&#146; projected cash flows, and discounted such cash flows and terminal values to their present value using real discount rates ranging from 4.0% to 6.0%. tap securities utilized a real discount rate, which is standard in the timber industry, as opposed to a nominal discount rate. in connection with its analysis, tap securities assumed a cash-free, debt-free operation of the subject lands, that the plantation timberlands would yield six tons per acre in the terminal year, and that a higher and better use cannot be achieved for the subject lands. this discounted cash flow analysis, based on a real discount rate of 5.0%, implied a reference range of $351 million to $441 million for plantation timberlands (not subject to timber deed), $21 million to $34 million for plantation timberlands (subject to timber deed), and $21 million to $23 million for non-plantation timberlands, and therefore a consolidated pre-tax range of $393 million to $498 million for the operations on the subject lands as a whole. in addition, tap securities calculated the present value of taxes that would be due on such cash flows, assuming a 38.6% tax rate, and applying a real discount rate of 5.0% and terminal growth rate percentage ranges of (1.0%) ;to 1.0%, resulting in a range of taxes of $158 million to $200 million and a consolidated after-tax valuation range of $234 million to $298 million for the operations on the subject lands as a whole. tap securities noted that the purchase price was above the range of implied values calculated on the basis of the discounted cash flow analysis.    ; 28      table of contents   "

company calculated a range of indications of the present value of unlevered free cash flows for the content delivery and storage business for the projected fiscal years ending june 30, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 using discount rates ranging from 19.4% to 23.4%. the range of discount rates, reflecting an estimated range of weighted average costs of capital of the content delivery and storage business, was selected by needham &amp; company utilizing its professional judgment and experience. needham &amp; company then calculated a range of illustrative terminal enterprise values at the end of the fiscal year ending june 30, 2022 based on each case for the applicable discount rates. in the case where needham &amp; company used a revenue multiple valuation of the terminal value, needham &amp; company then calculated a range of illustrative terminal enterprise values at the end of the fiscal year ending june 30, 2022 by applying multiples ranging from 0.8x to 1.2x to our management&#146;s estimate of our fiscal year 2022 revenue for the content delivery and storage business. in the case where needham &amp;

or &#147;selected transactions analysis&#148; as a comparison is identical to concurrent, the content delivery and storage business or the asset sale. accordingly, an evaluation of the results of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in the financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the selected companies or selected transactions or the business segment, company or transaction to which they are being compared.   the summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by needham &amp; company in connection with the rendering of its opinion. the preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant quantitative and qualitative methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. accordingly, needham &amp; company believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses or the factors that it considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. needham &amp; company did not attribute any specific weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. the fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis.   in performing its analyses, needham &amp; company made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of concurrent or vecima. any estimates contained in or underlying these analyses, including estimates of the future performance of the content delivery and storage business, are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates. additionally, analyses relating to the values of businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. needham &amp; company&#146;s opinion and its related analyses were only one of many factors considered by the members of our board of directors in their evaluation of the asset sale and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the board of directors or management with respect to the consideration to be received by concurrent pursuant to the asset purchase agreement or the asset sale.   under the terms of its engagement letter with needham &amp; company, concurrent has paid or agreed to pay needham &amp; company a nonrefundable fee of $200,000 that became payable upon needham &amp; company&#146;s delivery of its opinion on october 13, 2017. if the asset sale is consummated, concurrent has agreed to pay needham &amp;

opinion to the altera board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the altera board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. the foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by goldman sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of goldman sachs attached as annex b to this proxy statement.  goldman sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. goldman sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities in which they invest or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of altera, intel, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for the accounts of goldman sachs and its affiliates and employees and their customers. goldman sachs acted as financial advisor to altera in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. goldman sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to intel and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the investment banking division of goldman sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a participant in intel&#146;s commercial paper program since 2011, and having acted as financial advisor to intel on its acquisition of stonesoft oyj in july 2013. during the two year period ended may ;31, 2015, the investment banking division of goldman sachs has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided to intel and/or its affiliates of approximately $3.9 million. goldman sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to altera, intel and their respective affiliates for which goldman sachs&#146; investment banking division may receive compensation.  the altera board selected goldman sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. pursuant to a letter agreement dated january ;5, 2015, altera engaged goldman sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible sale. the engagement letter between altera and goldman sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of june ;1, 2015, at approximately $35 million, approximately $7 million of which became payable upon execution of the merger agreement and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. in addition, altera has agreed to reimburse goldman sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements, and to indemnify goldman sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.  financial forecasts  although altera does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose projections as to its future financial performance, altera provided certain internal financial analyses and projections, for 2015 through 2019, to intel. in addition, based on certain estimates and assumptions of altera management, the altera board considered financial information for the period 2020 to 2024 extrapolated from the forecasts for the period 2015 through 2019. we refer to the forecasts for 2015 to 2019 together with the financial information for 2020 to 2024 as the &#147;forecasts.&#148;    ; 50      table of contents   the forecasts were not prepared with a view to compliance with (1) ;generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the united states, which we refer to as &#147;gaap;&#148; (2) ;the published guidelines of the sec regarding projections and forward-looking statements; or (3) ;the guidelines established by the american institute of certified public accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. the forecasts included in this proxy statement were not prepared by, and are not the responsibility of, pricewaterhousecoopers llp, our independent registered public accounting firm. furthermore, pricewaterhousecoopers llp has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the forecasts and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. the pricewaterhousecoopers llp report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to altera&#146;s historical financial information. it does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.  readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the forecasts set forth below. although the forecasts are presented with numerical specificity, the forecasts reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by altera management that they believed were reasonable at the time the forecasts were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to altera management at the time. however, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. important factors that may affect actual results and cause the forecasts not to be achieved include (1) general economic conditions; (2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or projected cash flows; (4) competitive pressures; and (5) changes in tax laws. in addition, the forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. as a result, there can be no assurance that the forecasts will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the forecasts. the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the altera board, altera or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the forecasts to be predictive of actual future results. the forecasts are not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any altera stockholder to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. altera does not intend to update or otherwise revise the forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the forecasts are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate.    ; 51      table of contents   as referred to below, ebitda is a financial measure commonly used in the semiconductor industry but is not defined under gaap. ebitda represents income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. we believe that ebitda is a performance measure that provides securities analysts, investors and other interested parties with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry. we further believe that ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an ebitda measure when reporting their results. we believe that ebitda facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by adjusting for potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net interest expense), taxation (such as the impact of differences in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. ebitda has limitations, including that it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled financial measures of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.   ;

of estimated future cash flows of the asset. &#147;present value&#148; refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors. to calculate the estimated enterprise value of spartech using the discounted cash flow method, barclays added (i) ;spartech&#146;s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 based on management projections to (ii) ;the &#147;terminal value&#148; of spartech as of 2017, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range of selected discount rates. the after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the tax-affected estimated ebitda for the fiscal years ended 2012 through 2017 and subtracting capital expenditures and adjusting for changes in working capital. in the first discounted cash flow analysis, or the dcf analysis (ebitda multiple), the residual value of spartech at the end of the forecast period, or &#147;terminal value,&#148; was estimated by selecting a range of terminal value multiples of 5.25x to 5.75x for the period ending 2017 and applying such range to the management projections, which included a base case, upside case and downside case. the dcf analysis (ebitda multiple) excluded the impact of any contingent or similar liabilities. in the second discounted cash flow analysis, or the dcf analysis (average ebitda multiple), the terminal value of spartech was estimated by selecting a range of terminal value multiples of 6.0x to 6.5x, which were based on the average of spartech&#146;s estimated ebitda for 2010 through 2017 and applying such range to the management projections, which included a base case, upside case and downside case. in the third discounted cash flow analysis, or the dcf analysis (perpetuity growth), the terminal value of spartech was estimated by selecting a range of perpetuity growth rates and applying them to the after-tax unlevered free cash flows of fiscal year 2017 based on management projections, which included a base case, upside case and downside case. the range of perpetuity growth rates selected was 2.75% to 3.25%. in each of the three discounted cash flow analyses, barclays used a range of after-tax discount rates of 12.75% to 13.75%, which it selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of spartech and the comparable companies. barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of spartech by subtracting net debt as of september ;30, 2012 from the estimated enterprise value    ;

124,"discounted cash flow analysis  each of the axiall financial advisors separately conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value per share for axiall shares. a discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their present value. the &#147;unlevered free cash flows&#148; or &#147;free cash flows&#148; refer to a calculation of the future cash flows of an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. for purposes of the foregoing calculation, stock-based compensation is treated as a cash expense. &#147;present value&#148; refers to the current value of one or more future cash payments from an asset, which current value is referred to as that asset&#146;s cash flows, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. &#147;terminal value&#148; refers to the capitalized value of all cash flows from an asset for periods beyond the final forecast period. &#147;ev&#148; or &#147;av&#148; refers to aggregate enterprise value, calculated as market capitalization plus book value of total debt, plus non-controlling interest (as appropriate for the company being analyzed), less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. &#147;ebitda&#148; as used herein refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude nonrecurring and other similar items and one-time charges; for axiall, such adjusted ebitda would include the adjustments under &#147;adjusted ebitda&#148; described below under &#147;"

  ;    table of contents  case and the optimistic case were based on devicor&#146;s own sales projections for 2011 and 2012 with an average growth rate of 7.1% and 18.2%, respectively by scenario, per year thereafter through 2015 and a modest growth rate of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively by scenario, thereafter through 2022. the optimistic case reflected the possibility that our drug product, lymphoseek, may positively influence future sales of our gamma detection devices for several years following lymphoseek&#146;s approval. this assumed growth was the basis for the &#147;earn-out&#148; royalty which we may earn if devicor achieves net revenue related to the gds business in excess of $21 million. in addition, we provided these two projection scenarios to our financial advisor, and also provided our financial advisor with a third scenario, referred to as the conservative case, which is also summarized below. the third scenario also used devicor&#146;s sales projections for 2011 as a starting point, but then assumed that, starting in 2012, the gds business, in the absence of positive external influences or if the current installed base of devices were underutilized, would begin to experience market saturation and that sales would start to decline at an estimated rate of 8.7% per year. our management informed our financial advisor that, in management&#146;s opinion, the conservative case was the most appropriate scenario to use for purposes of ubs&#146;s opinion.   below, we have included material portions of these projections, which we refer to as the projections, to give our stockholders access to certain nonpublic information prepared for purposes of considering and evaluating the asset sale. in all scenarios prepared, gross margins on product sales were held consistent with our historical range of experience and direct operating expenses were assumed at historical levels with an assumed growth. the projections were prepared by neoprobe&#146;s management for internal use and were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the sec or the american institute of certified public accountants regarding forward-looking information or generally accepted accounting principles.   neither neoprobe&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm, bdo usa, llp, nor any other independent accountants have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or given any form of assurance on the projections or their achievability. the projections are the sole responsibility of our management. furthermore, the projections:                             &#149;

           revenue growth;                                 &#149;            costs and operating expenses;                                 &#149;            a lack of any significant development projects intended to expand product offerings or capabilities; and                                 &#149;            a lack of future acquisitions for the gds business.       non-gaap financial measures   as noted above, the projections have been prepared on a non-gaap basis, which, as stated above, excludes general corporate overhead, stock-based compensation expenses, and amortization of intangible assets. we believe that the non-gaap measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported gaap results, assist in the understanding of our results of operations, and in the case of this transaction, provide potential buyers such as devicor with a more thorough understanding of the resources that would need to be expended by their organization following the acquisition of the gds business.   neoprobe uses non-gaap financial measures internally to evaluate its performance from period to period and against our operating budgets. we also believe that investors benefit from seeing &#147;through the eyes of management&#148; as our operating budgets and compensation programs are based on the non-gaap financial measures. the economic substance behind our decision to use such non-gaap measures is that such measures approximate our controllable operating performance more closely than the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.   the material limitation associated with the use of the non-gaap financial measures is that the non-gaap measures do not reflect the full economic impact of our activities and reliance solely on non-gaap measures may lead management to make business decisions with unanticipated economic consequences on our gaap financial results. we compensate for this limitation by not relying exclusively on non-gaap financial measures to make business decisions. we also continuously reevaluate which non-gaap measures are appropriate.     24     ;   ;    table of contents  risk factors relating to the asset sale   you should consider carefully the risk factors described below and those risk factors generally associated with our business contained in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2010, and our subsequent sec filings, along with other information provided to you in this proxy statement, in deciding how to vote on the proposal to approve the sale of the gds business to devicor pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement. see &#147;where you can find more information; incorporation by reference.&#148;   the risk factors described below are not the only ones facing neoprobe. additional considerations not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.   the asset sale may not be completed or may be delayed if the conditions to closing are not satisfied or waived.   the sale of the gds business to devicor may not be completed or may be delayed because the conditions to closing, including approval of the transaction by our stockholders and the absence of a material adverse effect before the closing, may not be satisfied or waived. if the asset sale is not completed, we may have difficulty recouping the costs incurred in connection with negotiating the asset sale, our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees may be damaged, and our business may be harmed.   if we fail to complete the asset sale, our business may be harmed.   as a result of our announcement of the asset sale, third parties may be unwilling to enter into material agreements with respect to our gds business. new or existing customers and business partners may prefer to enter into agreements with our competitors who have not expressed an intention to sell their business because customers and business partners may perceive that such new relationships are likely to be more stable. employees working in our gds business may become concerned about the future of the business and lose focus or seek other employment. if we fail to complete the asset sale, the failure to maintain existing business relationships or enter into new ones could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if we fail to complete the asset sale, we will also retain and continue to operate our gds business. the resultant potential for loss or disaffection of employees or customers of our gds business could have a material, negative impact on the value of the gds business.   in addition, if the asset sale is not consummated, our directors, executive officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction, and we will have incurred significant third party transaction costs, in each case, without any commensurate benefit, which may have a material and adverse effect on our stock price and results of operations.   failure to complete the asset sale may cause the market price for our common stock to decline.   if our stockholders fail to approve the sale of the gds business to devicor, or if the asset sale is not completed for any other reason, the market price of our common stock may decline due to various potential consequences, including:                             &#149;            we may not be able to sell our gds business to another party on terms as favorable to us as the terms of the asset purchase agreement;                                 &#149;            the failure to complete the asset sale may create substantial doubt as to our ability to effectively implement our current business strategies; and                                 &#149;            our costs related to the asset sale, such as legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the asset sale is not completed.         25     ;   ;    table of contents  if the asset sale is not completed, we may explore other potential transactions, but the alternatives may be less favorable to us, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete an alternative transaction.   if the sale of our gds business to devicor is not completed, we may explore other potential transactions, including a sale of the gds business to another party on such terms as the board of directors may approve. the terms of an alternative transaction may be less favorable to us than the terms of the asset sale and there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with or complete an alternative transaction with another party.   the amount of net proceeds that we will receive from the asset sale is subject to uncertainties.   pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the amount that we receive from the buyer is subject to the possibility of reduction by virtue of a purchase price adjustment described below under &#147;the asset purchase agreement ;&#151; ;general.&#148; the amount of net proceeds is subject to further reduction after the closing if the buyer successfully asserts claims for indemnification pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the asset purchase agreement. see &#147;the asset purchase agreement ;&#151; ;indemnification.&#148; furthermore, we may have unforeseen liabilities and expenses that must be satisfied from the after-tax net proceeds of the asset sale, leaving less to fund our remaining operations.   in addition, the royalty payments contemplated by the asset purchase agreement are subject to uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. it is possible that these payments may be materially less than we expect or may not be owed to us at all.   you are not guaranteed any of the proceeds from the asset sale.   the purchase price for the asset sale will be paid directly to our company. you should not vote in favor of the asset sale based upon the assumption that you will receive any portion of the net proceeds from the asset sale.   management could allocate, spend or invest the net proceeds from the asset sale in ways with which our stockholders may not agree.   our management could allocate, spend or invest the proceeds from the sale of the gds business to devicor in ways with which our stockholders may not agree, including allocation to growth of our product pipeline. the investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return.   by completing the asset sale, we will no longer be engaged in the gds business.   our gds business accounted for 94% of our revenue in 2010. by selling all of our assets primarily relating to the gds business to devicor, we will be exiting the business associated with our gds line of gamma detection device systems. if the asset sale is consummated, our lead radiopharmaceutical pipeline products and drug development portfolio will be our only operating businesses and, accordingly, our profitability will be entirely dependent upon these lines of businesses. these businesses have generated no appreciable revenue and have caused us to incur significant operating expenses and resulted in the incurrence of substantial losses. we expect to continue to incur operating expenses and anticipate our expenses and losses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to develop our research pipeline until at least such time as we are able to get one of our radiopharmaceutical products cleared for marketing, which may happen in 2012 at the earliest. even in the event that all royalty payments are received by us pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, these funds may not collectively be sufficient to fund our anticipated losses and expenses. accordingly, we may need to seek additional funding. we would likely seek such funding through public or private financing or some combination thereof. additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.   if the asset sale is completed, our remaining business and assets will be less diversified.   after selling our gds business, we will focus our efforts on developing our lead radiopharmaceutical pipeline products and drug development portfolio. we may encounter unanticipated difficulties or challenges as we transition into a specialty pharmaceutical company. if we are unable to address and overcome these difficulties or challenges, we may not be successful with our new business focus.     26     ;   ;    table of contents  our pharmaceutical business is generating losses.   we are currently experiencing losses in our pharmaceutical business and we expect to continue to use significant cash and incur increased operating expenses to support this initiative, including costs associated with the development of our radiopharmaceutical pipeline products, lymphoseek (tilmanocept) and rigscan, costs to develop and acquire technology and infrastructure to support our pharmaceutical business, promotional costs associated with reaching consumers, and costs of obtaining personnel with the necessary expertise. these investments, which typically are made in advance of revenue, may not yield increased revenue to offset these expenses. as a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential of our pharmaceutical business is uncertain. any evaluation of our pharmaceutical business and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in our early stage of development. some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to do the following:                             &#149;            maintain our current relationships, and develop new relationships, with customers, channel partners and employees;                                 &#149;            continue to grow our revenue and meet anticipated growth targets;                                 &#149;            manage our expanding operations and implement and improve our operational, financial and management controls;                                 &#149;            adapt to industry consolidation;                                 &#149;            successfully introduce new products and services for consumers;                                 &#149;            navigate complex regulatory and clinical development processes;

&#147;present value&#148; refers to the current value of one or more future cash payments from the asset, which is referred to as that asset&#146;s cash flows, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, capitalized returns and other appropriate factors. &#147;terminal value&#148;

186,"discounted cash flow analysis  j.p. morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for kci common stock. a discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their &#147;present value.&#148; &#147;present value&#148; refers to the current value of one or more future cash payments from the asset, which is referred to as that asset&#146;s cash flows, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, capitalized returns and other appropriate factors. &#147;terminal value&#148; refers to the capitalized value of all cash flows from an asset for periods beyond the final forecast period.    ; 39       table of contents   using 2010 as the base year, j.p. morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that kci is expected to generate during the time period from the second half of fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2021 based upon financial projections prepared by the management of kci which included financial forecasts for the years 2011 through 2015 and certain extrapolations approved by management of kci. j.p. morgan also calculated a range of terminal asset values of kci at the end of the 10.5-year period ending december ;31, 2021 by applying a perpetual growth rate ranging from 1.0% to 1.5% of the unlevered free cash flow of kci as estimated for the terminal period. the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal asset values were then discounted to present values using a range of discount rates from 9.5% to 11.5%, which were chosen by j.p. morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of kci.  the present value of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal asset values were then adjusted for kci&#146;s estimated debt, cash and cash equivalents as of june ;30, 2011 (as provided by kci&#146;s management).  j.p. morgan reviewed three different cases based on kci management projections of growth rates and profitability levels based on management&#146;s various assumptions about the future performance of kci&#146;s business. some, but not all, of the factors management considered include overall market demand for kci&#146;s key products and services, pricing, and competitive dynamics. the following table represents management&#146;s financial profile of the three business cases:   ;

40       table of contents    companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to kci, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. however, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies that operate in the industries in which kci operates and, in certain cases, have operations and businesses that, for purposes of j.p. morgan&#146;s analysis, may be considered similar to those of kci. the transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of j.p. morgan&#146;s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. the analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to kci and the transactions compared to the merger.  the opinion of j.p. morgan was one of the many factors taken into consideration by kci&#146;s board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger. the analyses of j.p. morgan as summarized above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of kci&#146;s board of directors with respect to the value of kci, or of whether kci&#146;s board of directors would have been willing to agree to different or other forms of consideration.  as a part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, j.p. morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. j.p. morgan was selected to advise kci with respect to the merger on the basis of such experience and its familiarity with kci.  j.p. morgan has acted as financial advisor to kci with respect to the merger, and will receive a transaction fee of approximately $34 million, $3 million of which was earned upon delivery of the opinion, and the rest of which will be payable upon completion of the merger. in addition, kci has agreed to reimburse j.p. morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify j.p. morgan against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the federal securities laws.  during the two years preceding the date of its opinion, j.p. morgan and its affiliates had commercial and/or investment banking relationships with kci, and affiliates of chiron holdings (the &#147;acquiror group&#148;) and certain of the acquiror group&#146;s portfolio companies, for which it and such affiliates received customary compensation. such services for kci during such period included serving as joint lead arranger of certain senior secured credit facilities of kci in january 2011.  such services for apax, a member of the acquiror group, and its portfolio companies during such period included acting as: (i) ;financial advisor to apax in connection with its acquisition of a controlling equity stake in tivit terceiriza&ccedil;&atilde;o e servi&ccedil;os sa in may 2010, (ii) ;financial advisor to central european media enterprises ltd.

derivative transaction entered into with kci in connection with its issuance of certain convertible debt securities in april 2008, which will be liquidated as a result of the merger. j.p. morgan&#146;s affiliate, and kci, respectively, likely will be required to make a payment to the other in connection with any such liquidation and j.p. morgan&#146;s affiliate likely will recognize a gain in connection with such liquidation. see the section entitled &#147;the merger agreement &#151; treatment of convertible notes&#148; beginning on page 61. in the ordinary course of their businesses, j.p. morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of kci or portfolio companies of the members of the acquiror group for its own account or for the accounts of customers, and accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities.  <font style=""font-family:times new roman"" size=""2"">kci unaudited prospective financial information  kci does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future performance, earnings or other results due to the unpredictability of future results and the judgments required for the underlying assumptions and estimates. however, in connection with the financial analysis conducted by kci&#146;s financial advisor, kci provided j.p. morgan with certain non-public unaudited prospective financial information based on estimates by kci management and upon certain assumptions. these estimates were prepared with respect to prospective financial information in connection with due diligence, and were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the american institute of certified public accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the sec regarding forward-looking statements or gaap. a summary of this information is presented below.  while the financial forecasts were prepared in good faith, no assurance can be made regarding future events. the estimates and assumptions underlying the financial forecasts involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory, industry and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industry in which kci operates, and the risks and uncertainties described under &#147;risk factors&#148;

the estimated future free cash flows prepared by the general partner and utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on numerous variables and assumptions made in good faith by the general partner at the time they were prepared. the general partner considered (i) the economic, competitive and regulatory environment consistent with conditions known at the time of preparation of the free cash flow estimates, (ii) revenue growth averaging 4.8% per year based various factors including historical trends and the general partners&#8217; industry knowledge (iii) operating expense growth of 4.6% per year based on various factors including historical trends and the general partners&#8217; industry knowledge and, (iv) an assumption that capital expenditures would decline from 23% of revenues in 2016 to an average of 9% for the period 2017 through 2020. the 2016 levels were higher due to estimated expenditures required to upgrade the physical cable system to an industry standard capacity of 750 mhz. &#8220;mhz&#8221; is a unit a measure standard in the industry for determining the capacity of a cable television system. a cable system with a capacity of 750 mhz is considered in the industry to be necessary to provide advanced services and remain competitive. these assumptions are inherently uncertain, were made as of the time the prospective financial information was prepared, and may not necessarily be reflective of actual results, either now or in the future, in light of changed circumstances, economic conditions, or other developments.   ; in order to establish a terminal value of the estimated free cash flows at the end of the projection period, the general partner used a constant growth model. under a constant growth model the general partner established a perpetuity growth rate of 1.5%. in establishing the perpetuity growth rate the general partner considered ncp-eight&#8217;s cash flow growth rate over the forecasted period and industry perpetuity growth rates published within the industry.   ; the cash flows and terminal value were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 13.2% which was based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis of the buyer utilizing the capital asset pricing model (capm). the weighted average cost of capital is derived from an estimate of two factors; (1) the cost of debt adjusted for the tax deductibility of interest expense, and (2) the cost of equity representing the rate of return required by investors for investing in assets with similar risk profiles as those of the buyer. in considering the first factor, cost of debt, the general partner evaluated the cost of debt of a hypothetical buyer assuming that such buyer would be financing the transaction under current market conditions. the general partner believes that the buyer&#8217;s actual cost of debt would be higher than what the general partner believes would be generally available to a hypothetical buyer. use of the buyer&#8217;s actual borrowing rate would result in a lower valuation for the assets of ncp-eight. these two factors, cost of debt and cost of equity, were then weighted based on the assumed debt to equity ratio of the buyer&#8217;s capital structure, which in this analysis was 60%/40%, to derive the weighted average cost of capital.  ; in summary, based on the forgoing projected cash flows for the period of 2016 through 2020, a terminal value based on a perpetuity growth rate of 1.5% and a discount rate of 13.2%, the general partner&#8217;s discounted cash flow analysis yielded an estimated value of $3,030,000 for the assets of ncp-eight.   ;

rights). rather, in reaching its conclusion, william blair considered the results of the analyses in light of each other and ultimately reached its opinion based on the results of all analyses taken as a whole. william blair did not place particular reliance or weight on any particular analysis, but instead concluded that its analyses, taken as a whole, supported its determination. accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above, william blair believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, may create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. no company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is identical or directly comparable to the company or the merger. in performing its analyses, william blair made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and economic conditions and other matters. the analyses performed by william blair are not necessarily indicative of future actual values and future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.  william blair has been engaged in the investment banking business since 1935. william blair continually undertakes the valuation of investment securities in connection with public offerings, private placements, business combinations, estate and gift tax valuations and similar transactions. in the ordinary course of its business, william blair may from time to time trade the company&#146;s securities for its own account and for the accounts of customers, and accordingly may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. in addition, in 2013, william blair provided advice and consultation to omnitracs llc, an affiliate of parent, in connection with an acquisition unrelated to the merger, which william blair discussed with the special committee. william blair received a fee of $1 million from omnitracs for such advice and consultation.  the company hired william blair based on its qualifications and expertise in providing financial advice to technology companies and its reputation as a nationally recognized investment banking firm as well as its knowledge of the company. william blair provided financial advisory services to the company from 2011 to 2013 pursuant to a letter agreement entered into in 2011 and received $75,000 as a retainer and $53,479.64 as expense reimbursement pursuant to such letter agreement. pursuant to a letter agreement dated august ;6, 2014, a fee of $500,000 became payable to william blair upon delivery of its fairness opinion. under the terms of the letter agreement, william blair will be entitled to receive an additional fee of approximately $1.86 ;million upon completion of the merger. the company also has agreed to reimburse william blair for specified out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and other independent experts retained by william blair) incurred by it in connection with its services in an amount not to exceed $35,000, and will indemnify william blair against potential liabilities arising out of its engagement, including certain liabilities under the u.s. federal securities laws.  certain company projections  in connection with the sale process, the company provided to parent and william blair certain projected and financial information concerning the company. the company&#146;s internal financial forecasts are prepared solely for internal use and capital budgeting and other management decisions and are subjective in many respects, and, thus, susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments.    ; 41      table of contents   the projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions made by the company&#146;s management with respect to general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. these estimates and assumptions regarding future events are difficult to predict, and many are beyond the company&#146;s control. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made by the company in preparing the projections will be realized and actual results may be materially greater or less than those contained in the projections below. the projections do not include the full value of anticipated transaction-related expenses.  the inclusion of certain projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the company or william blair or their respective affiliates or representatives (including their advisors) consider the projections to be necessarily material or predictive of actual future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. the projections in this proxy statement are being provided only because the company made them available to parent and william blair in connection with the process of selling the company and because they were relied upon by william blair in performing its financial analysis to formulate the fairness opinion delivered to the special committee. none of the company or william blair or any of their respective affiliates or representatives (including their respective advisors) makes any representation to any person regarding the projections by virtue of their inclusion in this proxy statement, and none of them intends to update or otherwise revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error. in this regard, shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these projections.  the projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the merger. the final projections were provided to parent and william blair on august ;22, 2014. there can be no assurance that the announcement of the merger will not cause customers of the company to delay or cancel purchases of the company&#146;s services pending the consummation of the merger or the clarification of parent&#146;s intentions with respect to the conduct of the company&#146;s business thereafter. any such delay or cancellation of customer sales is likely to adversely affect the ability of the company to achieve the results reflected in such financial projections. further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure to complete the merger and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.  the company&#146;s management did not prepare the financial projections below with a view to public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the sec or the guidelines established by the american institute of certified public accountants regarding projections or forecasts. the projections do not purport to present operations in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and the company&#146;s independent auditors have not examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections presented in this statement, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance of such information or the likelihood that the company may achieve the results contained in the projections, and accordingly assume no responsibility for them.    ;

273,"discounted cash flow analysis  barclays capital performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the company. barclays capital calculated illustrative value indications per share for the company common stock as of november ;17, 2010 using the lrp forecasts, which included financial projections from 2011 to 2014 which barclays capital used to determine estimated cash flows for 2015 and 2016, and by combining the total present value of the estimated unlevered free cash flows for the period beginning october ;31, 2010 and ending on october ;31, 2015 and the present value of terminal values based on october ;31, 2016 estimated ebitda and using a range of terminal ebitda multiples of 6.5x to 7.5x. unlevered free cash flow was calculated using the lrp forecasts by taking the company&#146;s projected ebit minus taxes (using the tax rate contained in the lrp forecasts) plus its projected depreciation and amortization, minus its projected capital expenditures and minus the projected increase in net working capital. stock-based compensation expense was treated as a cash expense for purposes of determining unlevered free cash flow. the range of terminal multiples was estimated by barclays capital utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the lrp forecasts and historical trading multiples of the company.  barclays capital calculated the present value of both the unlevered free cash flows and the terminal values using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting barclays capital&#146;s estimates of the company&#146;s weighted-average cost of capital. the weighted-average cost of capital is determined by the sum of (a) ;the market value of equity as a percentage of the total market value of the company&#146;s capital multiplied by the company&#146;s estimated cost of equity, and (b) ;the market value of debt as a percentage of the total market value of the company&#146;s capital    ; 38       table of contents    multiplied by the company&#146;s estimated after-tax market cost of debt. the company&#146;s estimated cost of equity was calculated using the capital asset pricing model which took into account the company&#146;s beta (a measure of the sensitivity of an asset&#146;s returns to market returns), betas of comparable companies, the risk-free rate and a historical equity market risk premium which was sourced from the ibbotson sbbi valuation yearbook.  combining the total present value of the estimated unlevered free cash flows and the present value of the terminal values resulted in a range of implied enterprise values for the company. barclays capital then deducted outstanding debt and added outstanding cash and equivalents from the company balance sheet as of august ;1, 2010 to determine a range of implied equity values of the company. the discounted cash flow analysis implied an equity value range for the company of $16.50 to $19.75 per share (per share values were rounded to the nearest $0.25 increment).  barclays capital noted that the merger consideration of $19.00 per share was within the range of implied values per share calculated using barclays capital&#146;s discounted cash flow analysis.

376,"discounted cash flow analysis   a discounted cash flow analysis estimates value based upon a company&rsquo;s projected future free cash flow, discounted at a rate reflecting risks inherent in its business and capital structure. unlevered free cash flow represents the amount of cash generated and available for principal, interest and dividend payments after providing for ongoing business operations. the discounted cash flow analysis is dependent on projections and is further dependent on numerous industry-specific and macroeconomic factors.  houlihan relied upon a 5-year forecast as provided by turbosonic management including expectations of future revenues and expenses. houlihan then considered turbosonic&rsquo;s historical working capital and capital expenditure trends. increases in working capital were assumed to be funded through turbosonic&rsquo;s cash account. debt free cash flows were estimated by adding projected depreciation to projected net income and then subtracting any capital expenditures and working capital additions. to be conservative, houlihan assumed no capital expenditures will be made over the forecast period. houlihan noted that historical capital expenditures have been low, consistent with turbosonic&rsquo;s asset-light strategy. some assumptions inevitably will not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. therefore, the actual results achieved may vary materially from the estimated results.  as of june 30, 2012, turbosonic had a net operating loss (&ldquo;nol&rdquo;) carry forward balance of approximately $5.4 million available to offset income taxes payable in years 2018 to 2032. as a general rule, nols can generally be used to recover past tax payments or reduce future tax payments. further, a successor corporation may be allowed to carry over the nol and certain other items of its predecessor under specific conditions; however after a reorganization or other change in corporate ownership, the use of certain carry forwards may be limited or prohibited. for purposes of its analysis, houlihan has included the tax benefits associated with turbosonic&rsquo;s nol based on estimated utilization without limitations. the present value of these tax benefits has been included in the fair value estimate derived via application of the income approach.  the second step in the discounted cash flow analysis is to discount the projected net cash flows to present value at an appropriate discount rate. for purposes of houlihan&rsquo;s analysis, the appropriate discount rate is a weighted average cost of capital (&ldquo;wacc&rdquo;), calculated using estimates of required equity rates of return and after-tax costs of debt based upon the pro forma average cost of debt for turbosonic.   ;houlihan employed a range of required rates of return based on turbosonic&rsquo;s estimated cost of equity. the derived range of 22.0% to 26.0% was developed utilizing the capital asset pricing model (&ldquo;capm&rdquo;). the capm is based on the proposition that any stock&rsquo;s required rate of return is equal to the risk-free rate of return, plus its risk         20      ; ;      premium. houlihan adjusted the capm with a size premium, as the companies in the peer group on which the beta is calculated are much larger relative to turbosonic. houlihan&rsquo;s analysis included a company-specific risk premium ranging between 3.0% and 7.0% to account for the risk associated with the forecasted growth relative to recent performance. the calculated range of discount rates is further supported by the rates of return required by venture capital firms. even though turbosonic would not be considered to be in an early stage of development, the significant risks surrounding turbosonic would justify a cost of capital similar to those required for a venture capital investment.  utilizing a terminal growth rate of 3.5% and a range of discount rates of between 22.0% and 26.0%, houlihan calculated the implied equity values. the results of houlihan&rsquo;s discounted cash flow analysis are shown below.

refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a range of discount rates that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.  to calculate the estimated enterprise value of smithfield using the discounted cash flow method, barclays added (i) ;the present value of smithfield&#146;s after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to (ii) ;the &#147;terminal value&#148; of smithfield as of december ;31, 2018, in each case based on smithfield&#146;s management ebitda projections and the sensitivity analyses. in calculating ebitda, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. the present value of the after-tax unlevered free cash flows was calculated using a range of discount rates from 7.5% to 8.5% in the case of the ebitda projections of smithfield&#146;s management, and 8.0% in the cases of the sensitivity analyses, each of which were selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of smithfield. the weighted average cost of capital is derived by application of the capital asset pricing model, which takes into account certain company-specific metrics, including smithfield&#146;s target capital structure, the cost of long-term debt, tax rate and betas for smithfield and selected companies which exhibited similar business characteristics to smithfield, as well as certain financial metrics for the united states financial markets generally. the after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the tax-affected earnings before interest and tax expense, then adding depreciation and amortization, subtracting capital expenditures and adjusting for changes in working capital. the residual value of smithfield at the end of the forecast period, or &#147;terminal value,&#148; was estimated by selecting a range of exit multiples for the period ending december ;31, 2018 of 6.0x to 7.0x, which in the case of the ebitda projections of smithfield&#146;s management corresponded to implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from (0.3%) to 1.8% and were estimated by barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account smithfield&#146;s management ebitda projections and the sensitivity analyses and historical trading multiples of smithfield and industry peers. barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of smithfield by subtracting estimated net debt as of may ;24, 2013 as provided by smithfield&#146;s management from the estimated enterprise value using the discounted cash flow method and dividing such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of smithfield common stock.  <font style=""font-family:times new roman"" size=""2"">the discounted cash flow analysis based on (a) ;the management projection case implied an equity value range for smithfield of $35.37 to $42.87 per share; (b) ;the management sensitivity 1 case implied an equity value range for smithfield of $30.59 to $35.50 per share; and (c) ;the management sensitivity 2 case implied an equity value range for smithfield of $24.16 to $29.03 per share. barclays noted that on the basis of the discounted cash flow analysis, the transaction consideration of $34.00 per share was: (a) ;below the range of implied values per share calculated using the management projection case; (b) ;within the range of implied values per share calculated using the management sensitivity 1 case; and (c) ;above the range of implied values per share calculated using the management sensitivity 2 case.
